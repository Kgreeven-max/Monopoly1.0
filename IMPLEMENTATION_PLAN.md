## Implementation Approach

1. **Incremental Development:**
   - Start with core functionality
   - Get a minimum viable product working first
   - Add features one by one

2. **Integration Testing:**
   - Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next
   - Ensure compatibility between components

3. **Documentation:**
   - Update README.md as new features are added
   - Maintain PINOPOLY_INDEX.md to track component status
   - Document API endpoints and socket events

4. **Priority System:**
   - Must-have features first (Phases 1-2)
   - Should-have features next (Phase 3)
   - Nice-to-have features last (Phases 4-5)
