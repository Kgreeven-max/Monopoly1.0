# Game Board and Space Management Documentation

## Overview
The game board system manages the physical layout of the Monopoly board, including properties, special spaces, and player movement. It's designed to handle all board-related interactions and space effects.

## Board Structure

### Space Types
```python
class Space:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = 0
        self.name = ""
        self.type = ""
        self.effects = []
```

Types of spaces:
1. Property Spaces
2. Special Spaces
3. Tax Spaces
4. Card Spaces
5. Corner Spaces

### Space Management
```python
class SpaceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.spaces = []
        self.special_spaces = {}
        self.property_spaces = {}
```

## Special Spaces

### 1. Go Space
```python
class GoSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.salary = 200
        self.bonus_multiplier = 2
```

Effects:
- Collect salary
- Apply bonus for passing
- Track passes

### 2. Jail Space
```python
class JailSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bail_cost = 50
        self.max_turns = 3
```

Effects:
- Player imprisonment
- Bail payment
- Turn counting
- Early release options

### 3. Free Parking
```python
class FreeParkingSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.fund_pool = 0
        self.collection_threshold = 100
```

Effects:
- Collect accumulated funds
- Reset fund pool
- Track collections

### 4. Go to Jail
```python
class GoToJailSpace:
    def __init__(self):
        self.teleport_position = 10  # Jail position
```

Effects:
- Move player to jail
- Start jail sentence
- Cancel current turn

## Property Spaces

### Property Management
```python
def manage_property_space(self, player, property):
    """
    Manages property space interactions
    - Check ownership
    - Calculate rent
    - Handle purchase
    - Process development
    """
    pass
```

### Development Rules
```python
def handle_development(self, property, player):
    """
    Handles property development
    - Check monopoly status
    - Validate development
    - Process payment
    - Update property state
    """
    pass
```

## Card Spaces

### Chance Cards
```python
class ChanceCard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.effects = []
        self.probability = 0.0
```

Types:
- Movement cards
- Payment cards
- Property cards
- Special action cards

### Community Chest Cards
```python
class CommunityChestCard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.effects = []
        self.probability = 0.0
```

Types:
- Windfall cards
- Payment cards
- Movement cards
- Special action cards

## Player Movement

### Movement Rules
```python
def handle_movement(self, player, steps):
    """
    Handles player movement
    - Calculate new position
    - Check space effects
    - Process landing
    - Update game state
    """
    pass
```

### Position Tracking
```python
def track_position(self, player):
    """
    Tracks player position
    - Update current position
    - Check for passing Go
    - Record movement history
    - Trigger space effects
    """
    pass
```

## Space Effects

### Effect Processing
```python
def process_space_effect(self, player, space):
    """
    Processes space effects
    - Identify effect type
    - Apply effect
    - Update game state
    - Notify players
    """
    pass
```

### Effect Types
1. Immediate effects
2. Conditional effects
3. Delayed effects
4. Chain effects

## Integration with Other Systems

### Player System
- Position updates
- Effect application
- Movement validation
- Space interaction

### Property System
- Ownership checks
- Rent calculation
- Development rules
- Property effects

### Financial System
- Payment processing
- Fund collection
- Transaction recording
- Financial effects

## Future Improvements

### Planned Enhancements
1. More special spaces
2. Enhanced card effects
3. Improved movement rules
4. Better space interaction

### Known Issues
1. Space effect timing
2. Movement validation
3. Effect chain complexity
4. Space interaction balance

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Spaces
1. Define space type
2. Implement effects
3. Add validation
4. Test integration
5. Document behavior

### Modifying Existing Spaces
1. Analyze current behavior
2. Identify improvement areas
3. Implement changes
4. Test modifications
5. Update documentation
