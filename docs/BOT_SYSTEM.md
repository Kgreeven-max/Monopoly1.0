# Bot System Documentation

## Overview
The bot system in the Monopoly game implements AI players with different strategies and difficulty levels. Bots are designed to make intelligent decisions about property purchases, development, and financial management.

## Bot Types

### 1. Conservative Bot
```python
class ConservativeBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.risk_tolerance = 0.3
        self.cash_reserve_ratio = 0.4
        self.property_preference = "low_risk"
```

Characteristics:
- Maintains high cash reserves
- Prefers low-risk properties
- Avoids high-value investments
- Focuses on steady growth

### 2. Aggressive Bot
```python
class AggressiveBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.risk_tolerance = 0.8
        self.cash_reserve_ratio = 0.1
        self.property_preference = "high_value"
```

Characteristics:
- Takes high-risk investments
- Maintains minimal cash reserves
- Prioritizes property monopolies
- Focuses on rapid expansion

### 3. Strategic Bot
```python
class StrategicBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.risk_tolerance = 0.5
        self.cash_reserve_ratio = 0.25
        self.property_preference = "balanced"
```

Characteristics:
- Balances risk and reward
- Maintains moderate cash reserves
- Focuses on property sets
- Adapts to game state

## Decision Making

### Property Purchase Decisions
```python
def evaluate_property_purchase(self, property, current_state):
    """
    Evaluates whether to purchase a property
    - Analyzes property value
    - Considers current cash position
    - Assesses risk level
    - Checks for monopoly potential
    """
    pass
```

### Development Decisions
```python
def evaluate_development(self, property, current_state):
    """
    Evaluates whether to develop a property
    - Analyzes potential return
    - Considers current cash position
    - Assesses risk level
    - Checks for monopoly status
    """
    pass
```

### Financial Management
```python
def manage_finances(self, current_state):
    """
    Manages bot's financial decisions
    - Maintains cash reserves
    - Handles loan decisions
    - Manages property sales
    - Optimizes asset allocation
    """
    pass
```

## Difficulty Levels

### Easy
```python
class EasyBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_accuracy = 0.7
        self.planning_horizon = 3
        self.property_valuation_error = 0.2
```

Characteristics:
- 70% optimal decisions
- Short planning horizon
- High property valuation error
- Basic strategy implementation

### Medium
```python
class MediumBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_accuracy = 0.85
        self.planning_horizon = 5
        self.property_valuation_error = 0.1
```

Characteristics:
- 85% optimal decisions
- Medium planning horizon
- Moderate property valuation error
- Advanced strategy implementation

### Hard
```python
class HardBot:
    def __init__(self):
        self.decision_accuracy = 0.95
        self.planning_horizon = 7
        self.property_valuation_error = 0.05
```

Characteristics:
- 95% optimal decisions
- Long planning horizon
- Low property valuation error
- Sophisticated strategy implementation

## Learning and Adaptation

### Performance Tracking
```python
def track_performance(self, game_state):
    """
    Tracks bot's performance
    - Monitors win rate
    - Analyzes decision outcomes
    - Tracks property value changes
    - Records financial growth
    """
    pass
```

### Strategy Adjustment
```python
def adjust_strategy(self, performance_metrics):
    """
    Adjusts bot's strategy based on performance
    - Modifies risk tolerance
    - Adjusts cash reserve ratio
    - Updates property preferences
    - Refines decision making
    """
    pass
```

## Integration with Game Systems

### Economic Cycle Response
```python
def respond_to_economic_cycle(self, economic_state):
    """
    Adjusts strategy based on economic state
    - Boom: More aggressive
    - Recession: More conservative
    - Stable: Balanced approach
    """
    pass
```

### Player Interaction
```python
def handle_player_interaction(self, player, interaction_type):
    """
    Handles interactions with human players
    - Trade negotiations
    - Property sales
    - Loan agreements
    - Alliance formation
    """
    pass
```
