# Economic System Documentation

## Overview
The economic system in the Monopoly game implements a dynamic economic cycle that affects property values, rent rates, and interest rates. It's designed to add realism and strategic depth to the game.

## Economic States

### 1. Boom
```python
class BoomState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.property_value_multiplier = 1.2
        self.rent_multiplier = 1.3
        self.interest_rate = 0.05
        self.duration = 5  # turns
```

Characteristics:
- Increased property values
- Higher rent rates
- Lower interest rates
- More favorable trading conditions

### 2. Recession
```python
class RecessionState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.property_value_multiplier = 0.8
        self.rent_multiplier = 0.7
        self.interest_rate = 0.15
        self.duration = 3  # turns
```

Characteristics:
- Decreased property values
- Lower rent rates
- Higher interest rates
- More challenging trading conditions

### 3. Stable
```python
class StableState:
    def __init__(self):
        self.property_value_multiplier = 1.0
        self.rent_multiplier = 1.0
        self.interest_rate = 0.10
        self.duration = 4  # turns
```

Characteristics:
- Base property values
- Standard rent rates
- Moderate interest rates
- Normal trading conditions

## Economic Cycle Management

### State Transitions
```python
def process_economic_cycle(self, game_state):
    """
    Manages economic state transitions
    - Tracks current state duration
    - Determines next state
    - Applies state effects
    - Notifies players
    """
    pass
```

### Random Events
```python
def trigger_random_event(self, game_state):
    """
    Triggers random economic events
    - Market crash
    - Property boom
    - Interest rate change
    - Special opportunities
    """
    pass
```

## Effects on Game Systems

### Property Values
```python
def update_property_values(self, economic_state):
    """
    Updates property values based on economic state
    - Applies value multipliers
    - Updates rent calculations
    - Notifies property owners
    - Records value changes
    """
    pass
```

### Rent Rates
```python
def adjust_rent_rates(self, economic_state):
    """
    Adjusts rent rates based on economic state
    - Applies rent multipliers
    - Updates property income
    - Notifies property owners
    - Records rate changes
    """
    pass
```

### Interest Rates
```python
def update_interest_rates(self, economic_state):
    """
    Updates interest rates based on economic state
    - Sets new rates
    - Updates existing loans
    - Notifies players
    - Records rate changes
    """
    pass
```

## Integration with Other Systems

### Player System
- Affects player strategies
- Influences property purchases
- Impacts loan decisions
- Changes trading behavior

### Property System
- Modifies property values
- Adjusts rent calculations
- Affects development decisions
- Influences property sales

### Financial System
- Changes interest rates
- Affects loan terms
- Modifies transaction values
- Influences investment decisions

## Economic Events

### Market Events
```python
def handle_market_event(self, event_type, game_state):
    """
    Handles market-related events
    - Property value changes
    - Rent rate adjustments
    - Interest rate modifications
    - Special market conditions
    """
    pass
```

### Player Events
```python
def handle_player_event(self, event_type, player, game_state):
    """
    Handles player-specific economic events
    - Windfalls
    - Financial setbacks
    - Special opportunities
    - Market advantages
    """
    pass
```

## Monitoring and Analysis

### Economic Metrics
```python
def track_economic_metrics(self, game_state):
    """
    Tracks economic indicators
    - Property value trends
    - Rent rate changes
    - Interest rate movements
    - Market conditions
    """
    pass
```

### Performance Analysis
```python
def analyze_economic_performance(self, game_state):
    """
    Analyzes economic system performance
    - State transition effectiveness
    - Event impact assessment
    - Player adaptation
    - System balance
    """
    pass
```

## Future Improvements
