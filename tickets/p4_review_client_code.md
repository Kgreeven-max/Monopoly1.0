# Ticket: Review Client Code

**Priority:** P4
**Status:** To Do

**Description:**
The backend code (controllers, models, routes) has undergone significant review, but the client-side codebase (`client/src/*`) has not yet been reviewed. Initiate the code review process for the frontend components, services, and pages to ensure quality, consistency, and proper interaction with the backend API and Socket.IO events.

**Directories to Review:**
-   `client/src/components/`
-   `client/src/services/`
-   `client/src/pages/`
-   Any other relevant directories within `client/src/`

**Tasks:**
1.  Populate the relevant sections in `code-review.md` with the file structure of the client codebase.
2.  Begin reviewing the client code, focusing on:
    -   Component structure and reusability.
    -   State management practices.
    -   API service integration (correct endpoint usage, error handling).
    -   Socket.IO event handling (subscription, data processing, UI updates).
    -   Code style and consistency.
    -   UI/UX considerations.
3.  Document findings and create follow-up tickets for any issues or required improvements.
4.  Update the checklist in `code-review.md` as components/directories are reviewed.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
-   The client codebase structure is added to `code-review.md`.
-   A systematic review of the client code is initiated.
-   Key areas (components, services, pages) are reviewed, and progress is tracked in `code-review.md`.
-   Tickets are created for identified frontend issues or improvements.
