# Ticket: Review Other Project Files

**Priority:** P4
**Status:** To Do

**Description:**
Beyond the core `src` and `client` directories, there may be other important project files (configuration, utilities, setup scripts, root-level files) that haven't been included in the formal code review process yet. Identify and review these files to ensure they are correct, up-to-date, and consistent with project standards.

**Potential Files/Areas:**
-   `app.py` (Main application entry point)
-   `src/utils/*` (Utility functions)
-   `src/migrations/*` (Database migration scripts)
-   `requirements.txt` (Dependencies)
-   `.env.example` / Configuration handling
-   Root-level scripts (if any)
-   Potentially `docs/` content accuracy related to code.

**Tasks:**
1.  Identify any relevant project files not currently covered in `code-review.md`.
2.  Add these files to the 'Other' section (or a more specific section if appropriate) in `code-review.md`.
3.  Review each identified file for correctness, clarity, and adherence to project standards.
4.  Document findings and create tickets for any necessary updates or fixes.
5.  Update the checklist in `code-review.md` upon completion.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
-   All relevant project files are identified and listed in `code-review.md`.
-   These files have been reviewed, and progress is tracked.
-   Any required changes have corresponding tickets.
